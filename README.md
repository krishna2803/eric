## What is Eric?
'Eric,' a convenient e-rickshaw booking app that covers the entire IIT-R campus, making campus travel seamless. Many times, students face challenges like e-rickshaw unavailability and drivers struggling to find enough passengers. Eric resolves these issues by digitalizing the service. Anyone can sign up using an email and use Eric. Payments are done using UPI, automatically calculating the together with the booking process. For riders, Eric solves the problem of finding a ride and simplifies payments, all in one app. The targer destination can be chosen from a list of predefined landmarks, including all bhawans and departments in the campus. By digitizing the e-rickshaw service, drivers can increase their passenger count. And with the implementation of an 'urgency' setting to match customers with rides based on their requirements, even more revenue can be generated per fare. Eric also uses various APIs to find the most efficient routes, allowing drivers to transport more passengers in shorter time. This service can be expanded beyond the campus, creating a seamless e-rickshaw network for a wider area. All you need is Eric.
